KesKit
======
Keskit is a Kit for Kes.

Kes needed to develop software for a school assignment and she decided to use Javascript.
This kit was created to get her up and running. The kit contains example Javascript, CSS
and HTML implementing a basic calculator. This calculator works in a desktop browser and
on a mobile device (tested using Firefox 41 on Linux and Android 5 using Cordova)

The instructions below work for Linux, Mac and Windows.

Substitute ios for android if you want to deploy for ios (you will need a Mac to deploy to ios).
Other platforms can be added but require modifications in gulpfile.js and index.html.

Step 1: Setup development environment
=====================================
This development environment uses version control system Git and the node.js
Make sure these are installed on your system:

  - install Git
      Linux: use your package manager
      Mac: http://git-scm.com/download
      Windows: https://git-for-windows.github.io
  
  - install npm
      run installer from https://nodejs.org

Then download the Keskit project and install the packages needed for development:

  - get project
      > git clone https://github.com/tuxyme/keskit.git
      > cd keskit
  
  - install packages
      > npm install


Step 2: Run app in browser (live server)
========================================
- start local webserver
    > gulp serve

- open in browser
    http://localhost:9900


Step 3: Editing files
=====================
Use a proper editor to edit JavaScript, CSS or HTML files.
If you don't have one try Atom: https://atom.io
Changes to JS and CSS files will be loaded in the browser immediately



Optional: Setup mobile device deployment
========================================

- install cordova globally
    > npm install -g cordova
- change tree into cordova project (using existing config.xml)
    > mkdir www
    > cordova platform add android
- install adb (Android only)
    Linux: apt-get install android-tools-adb
    Windows, Mac: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other

- run on mobile device (standalone)
    - make sure config.xml has this content tag:
        <content src="index.html" />
    - prepare for mobile deployment
        > gulp deploy
    - connect mobile device, check connection:
        > adb devices
    - install on device
        > cordova run android --device

- to run app on mobile device (run live server)
    - edit config.xml and replace
        <content src="index.html" />
      with
        <content src="http://192.168.1.1" />
      (replace 192.168.1.1 with the IP address of the computer running the live server)
    - prepare for mobile deployment
        > gulp deploy
    - install on device
        > cordova run android --device
    - start local webserver
        > gulp serve
